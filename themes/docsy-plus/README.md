git submodule add https://github.com/puzzle/docsy-plus.git themes/docsy-plus
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

theme = ["docsy-plus", "docsy"]
```


## Shortcodes and Additional Features

For docsy shortcodes see here: [Docsy Shortcodes](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/adding-content/shortcodes/).


## Enhanced Cover Block

The blocks/cover shortcode from [docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/adding-content/iconsimages/#add-images) has been enhanced in order to support config-dependend background an logo images.

If you add an imagePrefix setting under your site params, this prefix is used to search for background and logo images.

As example with the following setting...

```toml
[params]
imagePrefix = "fancy_"
```

... background images which contain "fancy_background" and logo images with "fancy_logo" in the filename are detected.


## Details

A shortcode to generate HTML _details_ and _summary_ tags, which is handy to make solutions-sections foldable.

Usage:

```html
{{% details title="Lab 1" %}}
Lab 1 solution
{{% /details %}}
```

## OnlyWhen and OnlyWhenNot

This shortcode is used to display or hide content based on enabled modules.

Example module configuration within your sites config.toml:

```toml
enabledModule = "base extra"
```

Use the shortcode as follows:

```html
{{% onlyWhen extra %}}
This is only displayed if extra is enabled.
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

{{% onlyWhenNot extra %}}
This only shown if extra is NOT enabled.
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}
```

Use `{{< onlyWhen extra >}}` in plain HTML files


## Dynamicaly replace content

The features is used to dynamicaly replace content on html pages with a value taken from an URL param.
This makes it possible to individualize content with references to your personal lab environment.

For the following page loads the setting will be persistet using localStorage of your browser.
